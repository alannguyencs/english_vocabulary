lesson 8_1
Hi, George! Glad you're back. Loads of people have phoned you.
Really?
I felt just like your secretary!
Sorry! I went into the library this afternoon to have a look at a newspaper
and I came across something really interesting.
What? A book?
No, a brochure from a summer festival - mainly Spanish music. Look, I've got it here.
Spanish music? I really love the guitar.
Let's have a look. So what's this group 'Guitarrini'?
